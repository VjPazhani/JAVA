Java Data Types

As the name suggests, data types specify the type of data that can be 
stored inside variables in Java.

Java is a statically-typed language. This means that all variables must be
declared before they can be used.

There are 8 primitive datatypes :

        Boolean

        byte

        short

        int

        long

        double

        float

        charecter

        string
