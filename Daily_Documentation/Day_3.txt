I got question that is how to get multiple user input from java
Then I Start know :
    if you create a scanner object and it can be used for multiple variables to get user input.
        for example this is the way for creating a scanner object
            Scanner Object_name = new Scanner(System.in);
            and get user input from scanner object
                int a = Object_name.nextInt();
                 Object_name.close();
                    suppose u want multiple user input in the same program u can use that scanner object
                        int b = Object_name.nextInt();
                        int c = Object_name.nextInt();
